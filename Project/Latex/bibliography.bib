  abstract = {The computational power of massively parallel networks of simple processing elements resides in the communication bandwidth provided by the hardware connections between elements. These connections can allow a significant fraction of the knowledge of the system to be applied to an instance of a problem in a very short time. One kind of computation for which massively parallel networks appear to be well suited is large constraint satisfaction searches, but to use the connections efficiently two conditions must be met: First, a search technique that is suitable for parallel networks must be found. Second, there must be some way of choosing internal representations which allow the preexisting hardware connections to be used efficiently for encoding the constraints in the domain being searched. We describe a general parallel search method, based on statistical mechanics, and we show how it leads to a general learning rule for modifying the connection strengths so as to incorporate knowledge about a task domain in an efficient way. We describe some simple examples in which the learning algorithm creates internal representations that are demonstrably the most efficient way of using the preexisting connectivity structure.}

The aim is to provide a system for user identification rather than a classification. Additionally, a robust hand segmentation method to extract the hand silhouette and a set of geometric features in hard and complex environments is described. This paper focuses on studying how important and discriminating the hand geometric features are, and if they are suitable in developing a robust and reliable biometric identification. Several public databases have been used to test our method. As a result, the number of required features have been drastically reduced from datasets with more than 400 features. In fact, good classification rates with about 50 features on average are achieved, with a 100% accuracy using the GA–LDA strategy for the GPDS database and 97% for the CASIA and IITD databases, approximately. For these last contact-less databases, reasonable EER rates are also obtained.}
