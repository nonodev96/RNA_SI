  abstract = {The computational power of massively parallel networks of simple processing elements resides in the communication bandwidth provided by the hardware connections between elements. These connections can allow a significant fraction of the knowledge of the system to be applied to an instance of a problem in a very short time. One kind of computation for which massively parallel networks appear to be well suited is large constraint satisfaction searches, but to use the connections efficiently two conditions must be met: First, a search technique that is suitable for parallel networks must be found. Second, there must be some way of choosing internal representations which allow the preexisting hardware connections to be used efficiently for encoding the constraints in the domain being searched. We describe a general parallel search method, based on statistical mechanics, and we show how it leads to a general learning rule for modifying the connection strengths so as to incorporate knowledge about a task domain in an efficient way. We describe some simple examples in which the learning algorithm creates internal representations that are demonstrably the most efficient way of using the preexisting connectivity structure.}

The aim is to provide a system for user identification rather than a classification. Additionally, a robust hand segmentation method to extract the hand silhouette and a set of geometric features in hard and complex environments is described. This paper focuses on studying how important and discriminating the hand geometric features are, and if they are suitable in developing a robust and reliable biometric identification. Several public databases have been used to test our method. As a result, the number of required features have been drastically reduced from datasets with more than 400 features. In fact, good classification rates with about 50 features on average are achieved, with a 100% accuracy using the GA–LDA strategy for the GPDS database and 97% for the CASIA and IITD databases, approximately. For these last contact-less databases, reasonable EER rates are also obtained.}

  abstract   = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have promoted a variety of applications in computer vision and natural language processing, among others, due to its generative model’s compelling ability to generate realistic examples plausibly drawn from an existing distribution of samples. GAN not only provides impressive performance on data generation-based tasks but also stimulates fertilization for privacy and security oriented research because of its game theoretic optimization strategy. Unfortunately, there are no comprehensive surveys on GAN in privacy and security, which motivates this survey to summarize systematically. The existing works are classified into proper categories based on privacy and security functions, and this survey conducts a comprehensive analysis of their advantages and drawbacks. Considering that GAN in privacy and security is still at a very initial stage and has imposed unique challenges that are yet to be well addressed, this article also sheds light on some potential privacy and security applications with GAN and elaborates on some future research directions.},

  abstract  = {Machine-learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly utilized in privacy-sensitive applications such as predicting lifestyle choices, making medical diagnoses, and facial recognition. In a model inversion attack, recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al., adversarial access to an ML model is abused to learn sensitive genomic information about individuals. Whether model inversion attacks apply to settings outside theirs, however, is unknown. We develop a new class of model inversion attack that exploits confidence values revealed along with predictions. Our new attacks are applicable in a variety of settings, and we explore two in depth: decision trees for lifestyle surveys as used on machine-learning-as-a-service systems and neural networks for facial recognition. In both cases confidence values are revealed to those with the ability to make prediction queries to models. We experimentally show attacks that are able to estimate whether a respondent in a lifestyle survey admitted to cheating on their significant other and, in the other context, show how to recover recognizable images of people's faces given only their name and access to the ML model. We also initiate experimental exploration of natural countermeasures, investigating a privacy-aware decision tree training algorithm that is a simple variant of CART learning, as well as revealing only rounded confidence values. The lesson that emerges is that one can avoid these kinds of MI attacks with negligible degradation to utility.},

  abstract = {This article presents a novel scale- and rotation-invariant detector and descriptor, coined SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features). SURF approximates or even outperforms previously proposed schemes with respect to repeatability, distinctiveness, and robustness, yet can be computed and compared much faster. This is achieved by relying on integral images for image convolutions; by building on the strengths of the leading existing detectors and descriptors (specifically, using a Hessian matrix-based measure for the detector, and a distribution-based descriptor); and by simplifying these methods to the essential. This leads to a combination of novel detection, description, and matching steps. The paper encompasses a detailed description of the detector and descriptor and then explores the effects of the most important parameters. We conclude the article with SURF’s application to two challenging, yet converse goals: camera calibration as a special case of image registration, and object recognition. Our experiments underline SURF’s usefulness in a broad range of topics in computer vision.}

We make the following three contributions: (i) a new method to compare SIFT descriptors (RootSIFT) which yields superior performance without increasing processing or storage requirements; (ii) a novel method for query expansion where a richer model for the query is learnt discriminatively in a form suited to immediate retrieval through efficient use of the inverted index; (iii) an improvement of the image augmentation method proposed by Turcot and Lowe [29], where only the augmenting features which are spatially consistent with the augmented image are kept. We evaluate these three methods over a number of standard benchmark datasets (Oxford Buildings 5k and 105k, and Paris 6k) and demonstrate substantial improvements in retrieval performance whilst maintaining immediate retrieval speeds. Combining these complementary methods achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.},

  abstract  = {Localization by jointly exploiting multimodal information, like cameras, inertial measurement units (IMU), and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data, is an active key research topic for autonomous embedded systems such as smart glasses or drones. These systems have become topical for acquisition, modeling, and interpretation for scene understanding. The exploitation of different sensor types improves the robustness of the localization, e.g. by merging the accuracy of one sensor with the reactivity of another one in a flexible manner. This chapter presents a survey of the existing multimodal techniques dedicated to the localization of autonomous embedded systems. Both the algorithmic and the hardware architecture sides are investigated in order to provide a global overview of the key elements to be considered when designing these embedded systems. Several applications in different domains (e.g. localization for mapping, pedestrian localization, automotive navigation and mixed reality) are presented to illustrate the importance of such systems nowadays in scene understanding.},

  abstract = {3D face recognition (3DFR) has emerged as an effective means of characterizing facial identity over the past several decades. Depending on the types of techniques used in recognition, these methods are categorized into traditional and modern. The former generally extract distinctive facial features (e.g. global, local, and hybrid features) for matching, whereas the latter rely primarily on deep learning to perform 3DFR in an end-to-end way. Many literature surveys have been carried out reviewing either traditional or modern methods alone, while only a few studies are conducted simultaneously on both of them. This survey presents a state-of-the-art for 3DFR covering both traditional and modern methods, focusing on the techniques used in face processing, feature extraction, and classification. In addition, we review some specific face recognition challenges, including pose, illumination, expression variations, self-occlusion, and spoofing attack. The commonly used 3D face datasets have been summarized as well.}

abstract = {This tutorial will introduce the Computational Network Toolkit, or CNTK, Microsoft's cutting-edge open-source deep-learning toolkit for Windows and Linux. CNTK is a powerful computation-graph based deep-learning toolkit for training and evaluating deep neural networks. Microsoft product groups use CNTK, for example to create the Cortana speech models and web ranking. CNTK supports feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent networks for speech, image, and text workloads, also in combination. Popular network types are supported either natively (convolution) or can be described as a CNTK configuration (LSTM, sequence-to-sequence). CNTK scales to multiple GPU servers and is designed around efficiency. The tutorial will give an overview of CNTK's general architecture and describe the specific methods and algorithms used for automatic differentiation, recurrent-loop inference and execution, memory sharing, on-the-fly randomization of large corpora, and multi-server parallelization. We will then show how typical uses looks like for relevant tasks like image recognition, sequence-to-sequence modeling, and speech recognition.},
